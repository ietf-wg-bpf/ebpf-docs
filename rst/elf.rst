BPF ELF Profile Specification, v0.1
====================================

The Executable and Linking Format (ELF) is specified in Chapter 4 of the
System V Application Binary Interface.
This document specifies version 0.1 of the BPF profile for ELF files.

Documentation conventions
=========================

This specification is a extension to the ELF file format as specified in Chapter 4 of the
`System V Application Binary Interface <http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/contents.html>`_.
As such, the same data representation convention is used as specified in the Data Representation
section of the ELF specification, where structures are represented in a C-style format with types
such as ``Elf64_Word`` for an unsigned 64-bit integer.

NOTE: Some content in this draft will eventually move to a separate BTF draft.

ELF Header
=============

The ELF header must have values set as follows:

* ``e_ident[EI_CLASS]`` must be set to ``ELFCLASS64`` (2).

* ``e_type`` must be set to ``ET_REL`` (1).

* ``e_machine`` must be set to ``EM_BPF`` (247).

TEXT Sections
=============

`BPF programs <instruction-set.rst#instruction-encoding>`_ are stored in TEXT sections.
A TEXT section can contain multiple BPF programs, each with a different program name
which is stored as a function in a TEXT section.  The ".text" section can be absent or empty if
BPF programs are stored in other TEXT sections.

This specification does not mandate any particular convention for TEXT section names,
as there are multiple different conventions in use today, including:

* Prefix Convention: The section name is prefixed with a string that
  identifies the program type, so that the program type of any programs in the section
  can be determined by finding the longest substring match across all program type prefixes.

* Exact Match Convention: The section name is a string that identifies the program type
  of any programs in the section.

* Arbitrary Convention: The section name can be anything and the program type of any
  programs in the section must be determined without consulting the section name.

DATA Sections
=============

Classic Map Definitions
-----------------------

Classic BPF map definitions are stored in DATA sections named "maps" or matching
"maps/<map-name>".  Each such section can contain 0 or more map definitions.
The number of map definitions in a section can be determined by counting the
number of symbols in the ".symtab" section that point into that maps section.

The size of a map definition can be calculated as:

``(size of maps section) / (count of map definitions in that section)``

The format of a map definition is as follows, where fields are in the byte
order indicated in ``e_ident[EI_DATA]`` in the ELF header:

.. code-block::

    typedef struct {
       Elf64_Word    type;
       Elf64_Word    key_size;
       Elf64_Word    value_size;
       Elf64_Word    max_entries;
       Elf64_Word    inner_map_idx;
       unsigned char platform_specific_data[];
    } Elf64_BpfMapDefinition;

**type**
  An integer identifying the map type.  Its value and meaning are platform-specific.

**key_size**
  Size in bytes of keys in the map, if any.

**value_size**
  Size in bytes of values in the map, if any.

**max_entries**
  Maximum number of entries in the map, if the map type has a maximum.

**inner_map_idx**
  If the map type is one whose values contain ids of other maps, then the inner
  map index must be set to the 0-based index of another map definition in the section.
  The referenced map definition is used to enforce that any maps must match it
  for their ids to be allowed as values of this map.  If the map type is not
  one whose values contain ids of other maps, this must be set to 0.

**platform_specific_data**
  This field and its size is up to the runtime platform to define.  For example,
  on Linux 4.14 and later, this can hold a NUMA node value.

BTF Map Definitions
--------------------

BTF BPF map definitions are stored in a DATA section named ".maps".
The number of map definitions in a section can be determined by counting the
number of symbols in the ".symtab" section that point into the ".maps" section.

Program License
---------------

A runtime can optionally restrict what program types and/or helper functions
can be used based on what license the BPF program is under.  This information
can be placed into the ELF file in a section named "license" whose contents
is a null-terminated SPDX license expression as specified in Annex D of
`ISO/IEC 5962:2021, "Information technology -- SPDXÂ® Specification V22.1 <https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html>`_.

Runtime Version restriction
---------------------------

A runtime can optionally restrict whether a BPF program can load based
on what runtime version it was designed to interact with.  This information
can be placed into the ELF file in a section named "version" containing
a 4-byte version identifier whose use is runtime-specific.

Type and String Data
--------------------

The optional ".BTF" section contains type and string data.
The format of this section is the same as specified in
`BTF Type and String Encoding <btf.rst#2-btf-type-and-string-encoding>`_.

Function and Line Information
-----------------------------

The optional ".BTF.ext" section contains source line information for the first BPF instruction
for each source line.

The section starts with the following header:

.. code-block::

    typedef struct {
       Elf64_Half    magic;
       unsigned char version;
       unsigned char flags;
       Elf64_Word    hdr_len;
       Elf64_Word    func_info_off;
       Elf64_Word    func_info_len;
       Elf64_Word    line_info_off;
       Elf64_Word    line_info_len;
       unsigned char platform_specific_data[];
    } Elf64_BtfExtHeader;

**magic**
  Must be set to 0xeB9F, which can be used by a parser to determine whether multi-byte fields
  are in little-endian or big-endian byte order.

**version**
  Must be set to 1 (0x01).

**flags**
  Must be set to 0.

**hdr_len**
  The size in bytes of this structure including the platform_specific_data.

**func_info_off**
  Offset in bytes past the end of the header, of the start of the `Function information`_.

**func_info_len**
  Size in bytes of the `Function information`_.  Must be set to 8 (0x00000008).

**line_info_off**
  Offset in bytes past the end of the header, of the start of the `Line Information`_.

**line_info_len**
  Size in bytes of the `Line Information`_.  Must be set to 16 (0x00000010).

**platform_specific_data**
  This field and its size is up to the runtime platform to define.

BTF ID Values
---------------

TODO: make this section adhere to the ELF specification data format

The ``.BTF_ids`` section encodes BTF ID values that are used within the Linux kernel.

This section is created during the Linux kernel compilation with the help of
macros defined in ``include/linux/btf_ids.h`` header file. Kernel code can
use them to create lists and sets (sorted lists) of BTF ID values.

The ``BTF_ID_LIST`` and ``BTF_ID`` macros define unsorted list of BTF ID values,
with following syntax::

  BTF_ID_LIST(list)
  BTF_ID(type1, name1)
  BTF_ID(type2, name2)

resulting in the following layout in the ``.BTF_ids`` section::

  __BTF_ID__type1__name1__1:
  .zero 4
  __BTF_ID__type2__name2__2:
  .zero 4

The ``u32 list[]`` variable is defined to access the list.

The ``BTF_ID_UNUSED`` macro defines 4 zero bytes. It's used when we
want to define an unused entry in BTF_ID_LIST, like::

      BTF_ID_LIST(bpf_skb_output_btf_ids)
      BTF_ID(struct, sk_buff)
      BTF_ID_UNUSED
      BTF_ID(struct, task_struct)

The ``BTF_SET_START/END`` macros pair defines a sorted list of BTF ID values
and their count, with following syntax::

  BTF_SET_START(set)
  BTF_ID(type1, name1)
  BTF_ID(type2, name2)
  BTF_SET_END(set)

resulting in the following layout in the ``.BTF_ids`` section::

  __BTF_ID__set__set:
  .zero 4
  __BTF_ID__type1__name1__3:
  .zero 4
  __BTF_ID__type2__name2__4:
  .zero 4

The ``struct btf_id_set set;`` variable is defined to access the list.

The ``typeX`` name can be one of following::

   struct, union, typedef, func

and is used as a filter when resolving the BTF ID value.

All the BTF ID lists and sets are compiled in the ``.BTF_ids`` section and
resolved during the linking phase of Linux kernel build by ``resolve_btfids`` tool.
